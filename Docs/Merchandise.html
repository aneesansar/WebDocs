          <p>While we don't produce these items ourselves, we only choose the best partners
            to do so on our behalf. This benefits you because we're able to offer lower prices
            by utilizing a larger production mechanism and benefits us as we can better
            focus on our mission while still giving you something to enjoy. It is important
            for us that our products are climate-neutral and made only with high-quality
            ressources. These of course have to align with out objectives. This means that
            we take care to only use suppliers who respect our conditions: No forests should
            be harmed (this is a concern especially with cotton), the transport distance should
            be kept to a minimum, any carbon emissions created by this are to be offset by investing
            in other projects and every employee along the way (as well as farmers) should be
            receiving a fair wage. By setting these conditions we're able to ensure that
            what you receive is a good item produced in an environmentally friendly and
